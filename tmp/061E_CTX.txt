Draft Recommendation ITU-T X. GSBDaaS
Guidelines on security of big data as a service for Big Data Service Providers
Summary
Big data as a service (BDaaS) is a cloud service category that provides cloud service customers with capabilities to collect, store, analyze, visualize and manage big data, as specified in ITU-T Y.3600.
With remarkable growth of data volumes and rapid development of big data business, big data infrastructure has become the central facility to provide BDaaS.
Consequently, significant security issues arise for BDaaS.
For example, open source big data software design sometimes fails to take security into consideration from the beginning.
New technologies introduced by big data analytics can also result in failure of traditional security protection measures.
Recommendation X.GSBDaaS analyses security challenges BDaaS faces, identifies security roles and responsibilities for provision of BDaaS, as well as a security framework for a big data infrastructure.
It also specifies security protection measures that should be satisfied for services and components related to BDaaS.

Draft Recommendation ITU-T X.GSBDaaS
Guidelines on security of big data as a service for big data service providers
1
Scope
This Recommendation analyses security challenges faced by big data as a service (BDaaS) and provides guidelines for big data service providers (BDSP) to secure BDaaS.
It identifies security roles and responsibilities of BDaaS components and specifies a security framework for a big data infrastructure, including platforms, applications, analytics, interfaces, and the BDaaS ecosystem.
This Recommendation also specifies security protection measures that should be taken for activities or components related to BDaaS.
This Recommendation is a high level description of security requirements to BDaaS implementation which will focus on BDaaS.
As BDaaS involves big data infrastructure provider (BDIP) and big data application provider (BDAP), guidelines to both of them and detailed guidance on BDaaS implementation are out of scope for this document.

Conventions
In this Recommendation:
The keywords "is required to" indicate a requirement which must be strictly followed and from which no deviation is permitted, if conformance to this Recommendation is to be claimed.

The keywords "is recommended" indicate a requirement which is recommended but which is not absolutely required.
Thus, this requirement need not be present to claim conformance.

The keywords "is prohibited from" indicate a requirement which must be strictly followed and from which no deviation is permitted, if conformance to this Recommendation is to be claimed.

The keywords "can optionally" indicate an optional requirement which is permissible, without implying any sense of being recommended.
This term is not intended to imply that the vendor’s implementation must provide the option, and the feature can be optionally enabled by the network operator/service provider.
Rather, it means the vendor may optionally provide the feature and still claim conformance with the specification.

Security threats and challenges to big data as a service
This clause describes security threats and challenges to Big Data as a Service (BDaaS).
Cloud computing based BDaaS is defined in [ITU-T Y.3600].
Security challenges relevant to cloud computing environments as described in Chapter 8 of [ITU-T X.1601] should be taken into consideration for BDaaS.
This Recommendation, then, describes security threats and challenges to specific capabilities and services of BDaaS, that is, Big Data Platform as a Service and Big Data related Software as a Service (recognizing that the BDaaS ecosystem includes DPs, BDAPs and BDIPs), including:
vulnerabilities of big data infrastructure and failure of security measures;
storage and audit problems incurred by unstructured data;
security and regulation of interface between applications, platforms and service flow;
other security concerns, e.g., trust, authentication and visualization.
Figure 6-1 shows an architecture of BDaaS security challenges
.


Figure 6-1 – Big data as a service security challenges
6.1
Security challenges to a big data infrastructure
Big data infrastructure may consist of various components sourced either commercially or through open source.
The design of some of these components may fail to take security into consideration from the beginning, causing potential security risks, including:
insecure source code and lack of security mechanisms in open source components;
open and inter domain platform characteristics which blur traditional security boundaries, causing failure of boundary based protection measures; and,
lack of appropriate authentication and access control mechanisms for different roles may lead to abuse.
6.2
Security challenges to big data applications
A big data infrastructure integrates a variety of highly centralized applications with complicated service patterns.
Security challenges to big data applications include:
application programming interfaces (APIs), Software Development Kits (SDKs) and interfaces between applications may lack security verification and transmission control; and
execution of user applications needs to be traced, audited and located to guarantee business logic security.
6.3
Security challenges to data
Big data infrastructure and applications deal with massive quantities of data.
Within big data ecosystem, data types include structured, semi structured and unstructured data.
Structured data are often stored in databases which may be organized in different models, such as relational model, document model, key value model, graph model etc.
Semi structured data does not conform to the formal structure of data models but contain tags or markers to identify data.
And unstructured data do not have a pre defined data model and are not organized in any defined manner.
Within all data types data can exist in different formats, such as text, spreadsheet, video, audio, image, map, etc.
(see [ITU-T Y.3600]).
That data is used in storage, analysis, calculation and other data service phases.
Security challenges to data include:
requirement of security measures (including access controls) to ensure data confidentiality, while still supporting efficient data operation;
audit of unstructured data;
personal privacy information may be leaked if data is open or shared;
metadata has the same characteristics as data published on a web and traditional security measures described in [ITU-T X.1601] can be applied;
Security challenges to big data provenance handling include: contaminated or maliciously manipulated records throughout the chain of provenance processing, unauthorized entities in provenance data processing or exchange, unauthentic codes of processing for the data provenance, as well as security challenges to the provenance data.
6.4
Security challenges to big data as a service ecosystem
According to [ITU-T Y.3600], BDaaS ecosystem consists of roles and sub roles played by different parties/components providing and consuming big data services.
BDaaS ecosystem is required to plan, design and implement security measures in construction, operation, auditing and other phases of service provenance.
Security challenges to big data services include:
continuous monitoring of user action, network condition, resource status, etc. to cope with changing threats;
emerging new threat vectors and lack of potential protection mechanisms;
inability to establish trust between various actors, including data owners and devices (to collect data);
security of virtualization instantiation, e.g., security configuration and virtual image integrity;
A big data ecosystem may consist of a complicated supply chain.
Even a contractor who is not directly contracted with an organization may affect its business continuity.
Risks related to the supply chain should be analyzed and necessary measure should be taken, including security measures described in [ISO/IEC 27000] [ISO/IEC 28000].

High level concepts of big data as a service security consideration and role of BDSP
[ITU-T Y.3600] specifies an architecture of big data technology that is general, multi level and made up of logical function components.
Based on this architecture, big data service security capabilities cover both system security and data security.
From system security perspective,  BDaaS security requirements cover capabilities of each related function module of (1) big data infrastructure, (2) big data application management, (3) interface security, as well as (4) operation and maintenance of big data platform security (the BDaaS ecosystem).
In particular, [ITU-T Y.3600] describes BDaaS in two key components:
Big data infrastructure provider (BDIP): BDIP can use the cloud services of cloud infrastructure capability types such as compute as a service, data storage as a service, infrastructure as a service and network as a service to perform big data services for data collection, data processing, data management.

Big data application provider (BDAP): BDAP to perform data analysis, visualization and other big data applications.

From data security perspective, security requirements cover each data activity in the process of big data service business development.
Moreover, big data service security capabilities also include requirements for metadata security and data supply chain security.
From the system view of BDaaS, [ITU-T Y.3600] identifies the system context including roles and activities as well as data and service flows.

In terms of roles [ITU-T Y.3600], BDaaS services are offered by big data service provider (BDSP) which is responsible to ensure security of BDaaS and reduce risks.
It is recommended for BDSP (BDIP and BDAP) to consider both system security and data security to perform BDaaS activities.
